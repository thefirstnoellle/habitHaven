## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

My inspiration for this project was that I wanted an all-in-one app where I could keep track of my habits, be encouraged to maintain streaks, as well as let me record my thoughts or any notes I had about that day's progress because one thing I've learned about myself is that I'm more motivated to reach my goals if I have an easy way to track of my progress!
